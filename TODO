* incorrect benchmark: only Harness class is loaded by
  jrewriter.RewriterClassLoader.  Need to write Custom Harness class
  to make sure all classes are loaded with our class loader.

* More features: can allow local variables, not just constants.
  ICONST, also ILOAD

* Cover all cases?  No.  Static fields can be done by implementing a
  stack based simulator (interpreter), and just check there is not
  statement having side effects between GETSTATIC and SETSTATIC.
  Non-static fields are not possible because we cannot cover all cases
  of GETFIELD and SETFIELD operating on the same object.  Currently we
  make sure there are referring to same object and field by checking
  DUP instruction immediately before GETFIELD.

  An example of a case currently not handled: taking result of (i++),
  there is DUP_X1 instruction between GET and SET instructions.
